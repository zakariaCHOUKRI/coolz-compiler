## üåü Features

### üìù Lexical Analysis

- Full COOL token recognition including:
  - Keywords (class, if, then, else, fi, etc.)
  - Identifiers (Type IDs and Object IDs)
  - Literals (integers, strings, booleans)
  - Operators (+, -, *, /, <-, =, <, <=, etc.)
- Support for single-line comments (`--`) and nested multi-line comments (`(* *)`)
- String literal processing with escape sequences
- Line and column number tracking for error reporting

### üîç Parser

- Complete COOL syntax support including:
  - Class definitions with inheritance
  - Method and attribute declarations
  - Block expressions
  - Let expressions with multiple bindings
  - Case expressions
  - If-then-else expressions
  - While loops
  - Object dispatch (both dynamic and static)
  - Binary and unary operations
  - Object instantiation (new)
  - Self and void expressions
- Proper operator precedence handling
- Detailed error reporting
- AST generation with full source location information
- Fully functional Pratt parsing

### üîé Semantic Analysis

- Full type checking system including:
  - Class hierarchy validation
  - Method override checking
  - Type conformance verification
  - Self and SELF_TYPE handling
- Symbol table management with:
  - Proper scoping rules
  - Method and attribute tracking
  - Inheritance-aware symbol lookup
- Main class and main() method validation
- Multiple error detection and reporting
- Cycle detection in inheritance graphs

### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Generation

- LLVM IR generation with:
  - Full class layout generation
  - Virtual method tables
  - Proper object instantiation
  - Garbage collection support (planned)
- Built-in class support:
  - Object with abort(), type_name(), and copy() methods
  - IO with in_string(), in_int(), out_string(), and out_int() methods
  - String with length(), concat(), and substr() methods
  - Int and Bool with proper operations
- Expression generation for all COOL features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (Golang)
- Clang

### Building

```sh
go build -o coolz main.go
```

### Usage

Generate LLVM IR code:
```sh
./coolz -o output.ll input.cl
```

Compile to executable;
```sh
clang -o name output.ll
```

The previous command doesn't work on my machine (Windows 10 + visual studio dependencies) so instead I use this one, so in case it doesn't work for you too try this one, and if it also does not work then try to fix clang (the problem is not from the compiler because it generates a ir code that the user has to transform to machine code depending on their machine using clang or other)
```sh
clang-cl output.ll /Fe:name.exe /MD /link /subsystem:console libucrt.lib libcmt.lib legacy_stdio_definitions.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib user32.lib kernel32.lib msvcrt.lib
```
